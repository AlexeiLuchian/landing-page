Hey there! This is my 'Landing Page' from The Odin Project where I demonstrate my current knowledge in HTML and CSS by combining divs, flexbox and other tools in order to create a visually appealing landing page.  
Of course there's a lot more to learn and the project is currently far from perfect, but this is a good way to reflect over my progress and fix my bad coding habits or maybe get some hints on what improvements can be done.  
You can check the result by clicking the following link: https://alexeiluchian.github.io/landing-page/  
Thank you for checking in out!
